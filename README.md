# UMBC Whaling CTF Challenge: The CEO's Email

## Challenge Overview

Welcome to the UMBC Whaling CTF challenge! In this challenge, you'll analyze an email sent to a UMBC employee from a **fake CEO** of a UMBC-affiliated organization. The CEO is asking for an **urgent wire transfer** as part of a phishing attack targeting the UMBC community. 

Your goal is to carefully investigate the email and its metadata to spot the signs of a **whaling phishing attempt**.

### Challenge Instructions:

1. **Email Analysis**: Open the fake email and analyze the content for any suspicious elements.
2. **Domain Analysis**: Check the sender's email and the URL to spot fake domains.
3. **Header Investigation**: Inspect the email headers for discrepancies or spoofed domains.
4. **Flag Location**: The flag is hidden in the email. To find it, you need to identify the **fraudulent domain** in the link and reveal the flag.

Good luck, Retrievers! üéØüêæ
